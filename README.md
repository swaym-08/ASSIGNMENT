This repository contains my submission for the Volatility Pairs Trading assignment. The goal was to build, test, and compare various mean-reversion-based trading models on a volatility spread derived from two indices (e.g., BANKNIFTY and NIFTY implied volatilities).

I explored both classical statistical techniques and regime-aware filtering methods to improve the timing and quality of trades.
